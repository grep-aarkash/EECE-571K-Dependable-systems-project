\section{Conclusion}

In this project we study the effect of sensor faults in autonomous driving systems. We focus on faults in optical sensors and create a fault model for them. We categorize the faults in hardware and data faults. We perform fault injection experiments in CARLA simulator and find the failure rates of the system in presence of different types of faults. We show that data faults result in most of the failures and thus need to prioritized when studying faults of optical sensors. We also present some methods to to reduce the overheads of exhaustive fault injection but these methods reduce the coverage of FI experiments.

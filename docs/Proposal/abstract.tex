\noindent Autonomous vehicles (AV) have seen an immense increase in popularity recently and are expected to become fully operational on normal roads in near future. The safety critical nature of autonomous driving systems (ADS) of AVs makes quantifying the resilience properties of such systems highly important. This helps in ensuring public and governmental support for their adoption. Resilience of ADS in general has been explored before  but effect on reliability of ADS due to specific components such as sensors present in ADS still remains to be explored. We propose using a systematic approach to find vulnerabilities in ADS introduced due to sensors and compare its performance overhead and coverage with fuzz testing techniques.

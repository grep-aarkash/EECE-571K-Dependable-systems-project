\noindent Autonomous vehicles (AV) have seen an immense increase in popularity recently and are expected to become fully operational on normal roads in near future. The safety critical nature of autonomous driving systems (ADS) of AVs makes quantifying the resilience properties of such systems highly important, for ensuring public and governmental support for their adoption. Prior work in this area focuses on using Fault Injection techniques to assess the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, which do not provide good test coverage due to diverse range of possible inputs for control systems of ADS. We propose using systematic approaches based on formal methods to find vulnerabilities in individual sub-components of an ADS and finding the effect of these vulnerabilities on overall resilience of integrated autonomous driving systems..

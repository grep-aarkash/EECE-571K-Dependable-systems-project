\noindent Autonomous Driving Systems(ADS) have seen an immense increase in popularity recently and are expected to become fully operational on normal roads in near future. The safety critical nature of autonomous driving systems (ADS) of AVs makes quantifying the resilience properties of such systems highly important. This helps in ensuring public and governmental support for their adoption. Resilience of ADS in general has been explored before  but effect on reliability of ADS due to specific components such as sensors present in ADS still remains to be explored. 
\newline
We make three main contributions: 1. We find  the failure rate of  the system, in this case an ADS due to different categories of sensor faults 2. We define different categories of failures which can occur in an ADS and 3. We do a case study on one of the core sensors(optical sensors) in an ADS by defining it's faults and finding the failure rates of ADS due to optical sensors faults. We make use of CARLA- an open source simulator to help us conduct the experiments.

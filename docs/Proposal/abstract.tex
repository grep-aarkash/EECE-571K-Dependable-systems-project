\noindent Autonomous vehicles (AV) have seen an immense increase in popularity recently and are expected to become fully operational on normal roads in near future. The safety critical nature of autonomous driving systems (ADS) of AVs makes quantifying the resilience properties of such systems highly important, for ensuring public and governmental support for their adoption. Resilience of DNN portion of ADS has been greatly studied but effect on reliability of ADS due to other components such as sensors present in ADS still remains to be explored. Prior work in this area focuses on using Fault Injection without any systemic approach to assess the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles which also test the sensors present in the system do not provide good test coverage due to diverse range of possible inputs for control systems of ADS. We propose using a systematic approach to find vulnerabilities in ADS introduced due to sensors and compare its performance overhead and coverage with fuzz testing techniques.

\section{Evaluation}
In this section we present the fault model for the sensors. We further evaluate the failure rates caused due to the faults in the sensor. We address the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{RQ1}
	What all types of faults can exist in advanced and core sensors of Autonomous vehicles such as LIDAR?
	\item \textbf{RQ2}
	What subset of the above faults cause the most amount of system damage i.e system failure?
	\item \textbf{RQ3}
	What is the failure rate of the faults causing the most amount of damage?
	\item \textbf{RQ4}
	What mitigation strategies can we use for preventing those failure rates due to the particular sensor faults in Autonomous vehicles?
\end{enumerate}

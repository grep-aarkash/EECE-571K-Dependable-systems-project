\section{Background}
\subsection{ Autonomous Cars}
Self-driving autonomous cars use various autonomous technologies to provide an effortless mode of transportation. In order for autonomous cars to work effectively a proper synchronization of advanced sensors collecting data from surrounding environments and advanced algorithms processing data and the vehicle in real-time.

% Main components of self-driving car
The main components of a self-driving car are sensors ( we will talk about them in more details in the next subsection), computer processors, batteries, back-up systems ( eg. steering, braking etc.), rounded-shapes which maximizes the sensors coverage area and the interiors( designed for riding, not for driving). 

\subsection{Sensors}
Sensors are the core components in a self-driving car. We will talk about them in a little more detail, since our research goal is to find error rate in self-driving cars caused by sensor faults.

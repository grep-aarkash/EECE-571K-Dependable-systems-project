# Failure detection of Sensors in an Autonomous Car

This is a mini research project for the security and reliability course, where we find the failure rate of the sensor LIDAR in an autonomous vehicle. LIDAR is one of the core components of an autonomous vehicle which is used to create a map of its surrounding in order to guide the vehicle correctly.
